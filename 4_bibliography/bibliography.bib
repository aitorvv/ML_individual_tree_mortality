It is derived by the interpolation of monthly climate anomalies from extensive networks of weather station observations. Here we describe the construction of a major new version, CRU TS v4. It is updated to span 1901–2018 by the inclusion of additional station observations, and it will be updated annually. The interpolation process has been changed to use angular-distance weighting (ADW), and the production of secondary variables has been revised to better suit this approach. This implementation of ADW provides improved traceability between each gridded value and the input observations, and allows more informative diagnostics that dataset users can utilise to assess how dataset quality might vary geographically.

	abstract = {In forests, tree mortality strongly determines forest dynamics, creates gaps for recruitment and contributes to the coexistence of tree species. Individual-based models (IBMs) of tree mortality are key submodels in forest gap models and have been shown to drive simulated long-term forest dynamics. However, tree mortality IBMs remain poorly evaluated at the stand scale, particularly quantitatively, due to the lack of adequate tree mortality demographic data. Tree mortality dynamic data have often been absent from previous mortality IBMs, resulting in difficulty during model evaluation at the stand scale. The goals of this study were (1) to develop a spatially-explicit tree mortality IBM derived from the FORSKA forest gap model and (2) to evaluate its performance by both qualitative and quantitative fits based on a 10-year interval of tree mortality demographic data under a 9-ha forest dynamics plot (FDP) in an old-growth temperate forest in Northeast China. The results showed that, for model qualitative evaluation, the observed dead trees were mainly distributed in the southwest and northeast parts, but the predicted dead trees were centrally clustered only in the southwest part of the FDP. For model quantitative evaluation, the overall model error (Error (\%)) for all trees was −10.5\%. However, the absolute values of model error for some species (i.e., Acer spp., Betula spp., Tilia spp., Fraxinus mandschurica, and Ulmus spp.) and some diameter at breast height (DBH) classes (i.e., 30–40, 40–50, 50–60, 60–70, and ≥70 cm) were greater than or equal to 20\%. Our study highlights that the tree mortality IBM at the stand scale still requires further improvement to enhance the model performance and that the FDPs could provide crucial data support for initialization, parameterization and evaluation in the tree mortality IBM at the stand scale in forest dynamic modeling.},

	abstract = {Mortality as a basic process should be an integral part of any model of woody plant dynamics. But progress in developing mortality algorithms is slow. The aim of this paper is to provide a state-of-the-art description of mortality algorithms in published plant growth models, their structure, and the problems they face. The subsequent objective is to assess how models attempt to solve the problems, and provide some insight on how modelling mortality can be improved. Sixty-one models, concerned with forest yield and dieback and forest/shrubland dynamics, were reviewed, the greatest proportion being the gap type. The algorithms could be broadly divided into stochastic and deterministic. Despite considerable variability, the basic premise of every algorithm was the same: beyond a specified threshold a plant either dies (deterministic), or has a greater probability of dying (stochastic). Factors used to predict mortality include size, age, competition, carbon balance (growth) and abiotic influences. Some algorithms were random, and one-third used more than one predictor. Although the classification is far from clear-cut, mortality algorithms can be placed in one or more of the following classes: carbon-based, abiotic/age-based, competitive, gap-type, statistically fitted and progressive-stress type. It is clear both that mortality is difficult to model, and that there is no best way to model it for all applications. The complexity of environmental stresses and lack of process information of woody plant mortality has however led to the wide use of empirical algorithms. These have many problems, including data intensity and spatial and temporal specificity. Such problems render mortality simulation prone to error and weak in response to environmental change. Test data and procedures also are lacking. In the literature suggested improvements to the problem include the use of mechanistic algorithms. But this approach also has associated problems. So here it is suggested here that the use of a biologically reasonable predictor in a simple stochastic algorithm, used within a mechanistic model of plant growth, is a preferable improvement. The approach provides a mechanistic-empirical consensus. A shift in emphasis towards modelling for exploration and explanation, rather than to predict with high levels of accuracy is also suggested.

Los ecólogos han utilizado tradicionalmente en dichos estudios las rela-ciones lineales y las no lineales.

En los últimos años, la inteligencia artificial se ha convertido en una técnica que permite tanto la gestión de grandes bases de datos como la utilización de algoritmos que, aunque complejos en su estructura, arrojan resultados fácilmente interpretables. El trabajo que se presenta ofrece, por una parte, una introducción a la teoría de las redes neuronales y, por otra, la apli-cación de las mismas en la modelización ecológica. INTRODUCCIÓN La modelización de sistemas ecológicos es compleja y muchas veces parcial debido, en parte, a que no todas las variables independientes pueden ser medidas. En ocasiones la interacción entre variables o entre sistemas es tal que la modelización completa y precisa no es posible, por lo que se da un margen de error que conside-ramos aceptable en cada caso particular. Para evitar los problemas de dificultad en la modelización, la inteligencia artificial (IA) nos proporciona una serie de técnicas capaces de hallar relaciones predictivas cuando no se cono-ce ninguna fórmula matemática que relacione variables dependientes e independientes. Entre esas técnicas las redes neuronales han sido utili-zadas con más o menos fortuna en la modeliza-ción de sistemas ecológicos. El trabajo que se presenta trata de explicar en qué consisten dichas redes y muestra algunas aplicaciones de las mismas en las ciencias de la vida.},

	abstract = {L ike contingency table analyses and 2 tests, logistic regression allows the analysis of dichotomous or binary outcomes with 2 mutually exclusive levels. 1 However, logistic regression permits the use of continuous or categorical predictors and provides the ability to adjust for multiple predictors. This makes logistic regression especially useful for analysis of observational data when adjustment is needed to reduce the potential bias resulting from differences in the groups being compared. 2 Use of standard linear regression for a 2-level outcome can produce very unsatisfactory results. Predicted values for some covariate values are likely to be either above the upper level (usually 1) or below the lower level of the outcome (usually 0). In addition, the validity of linear regression depends on the variability of the outcome being the same for all values of the predictors. This assumption of constant variability does not match the behavior of a 2-level outcome. So, linear regression is not adequate for such data, and logistic regression has been developed to fill this gap. Some recent examples of use of logistic regression in Circulation include the assessment of gender as a predictor of operative mortality after coronary artery bypass grafting surgery, 3 an evaluation of the relationship between the TaqlB genotype and risk of cardiovascular disease in a meta-analysis , 4 and an examination of the relationship between lipopro-tein abnormalities and the incidence of diabetes. 5 The Logistic Regression Model The logistic regression model has its basis in the odds of a 2-level outcome of interest. For simplicity, I assume that we have designated one of the outcome levels the event of interest and in the following text will simply call it the event. The odds of the event is the ratio of the probability of the event happening divided by the probability of the event not happening. Odds often are used for gambling, and "even odds" (odds1) correspond to the event happening half the time. This would be the case for rolling an even number on a single die. The odds for rolling a number 5 would be 2 because rolling a number 5 is twice as likely as rolling a 5 or 6. Symmetry in the odds is found by taking the reciprocal, and the odds of rolling at least a 5 would be 0.5 (1/2). The logistic regression model takes the natural logarithm of the odds as a regression function of the predictors. With 1 predictor, X, this takes the form ln[odds(Y1)] 0 1 X, where ln stands for the natural logarithm, Y is the outcome and Y1 when the event happens (versus Y0 when it does not), 0 is the intercept term, and 1 represents the regression coefficient, the change in the logarithm of the odds of the event with a 1-unit change in the predictor X. The difference in the logarithms of 2 values is equal to the logarithm of the ratio of the 2 values, so by taking the exponential of 1 , we obtain the ratio of the odds (the odds ratio) corresponding to a 1-unit change in X. Odds ratios often are used in the analysis of 2-by-2 contingency tables 6 and case-control studies. 7 The odds ratio is sometimes confused with the relative risk, which is the ratio of probabilities rather than odds. Only when the probability of the event is very low can the odds ratio be considered a good approximation to the relative risk. 2 The odds ratio is more extreme than the relative risk, which leads to exaggeration of the effect of a predictor when it is misinterpreted as a relative risk. 8 In many settings, the relative risk is preferred over the odds ratio because it addresses the more readily understood probability of the event rather than its odds. 9 However, logistic regression results are typically presented by odds ratios because these are the natural estimates from the model and attempts to transform these to relative risks can distort the results. 10 A useful way to think of the odds ratio is that 100 times the odds ratio minus 1, ie, 100(odds ratio1), gives the percent change in the odds of the event corresponding to a 1-unit increase in X. If this value is negative, then the odds of the event decrease with increasing values of X; if positive, the odds increase. This percentage change is the same for any 1-unit increase in X because of the assumed linearity between X and the logarithm of the odds in the regression model above. For some continuous predictors, this assumption may not match the data, 11 in which case careful checking of the model results is required. For example, if the logarithm of the odds against the predictor X has a U shape (both low and high values have large odds of the outcome relative to the intermediate values) and the model assumes a linear (straight line) pattern, then goodness-of-fit checking should show that the model and the data are not compatible. In such a case, splitting the predictor values into categories and using dummy variables to code for the categories may improve the fit. 1 Other methods such as splines also may be used to lessen the assumption of linearity. 12 From the},

The SPEI is based on precipitation and temperature data, and it has the advantage of combining multiscalar character with the capacity to include the effects of temperature variability on drought assessment. The procedure to calculate the index is detailed and involves a climatic water balance, the accumulation of deficit/surplus at different time scales, and adjustment to a log-logistic probability distribution. Mathematically, the SPEI is similar to the standardized precipitation index (SPI), but it includes the role of temperature. Because the SPEI is based on a water balance, it can be compared to the self-calibrated Palmer drought severity index (sc-PDSI). Time series of the three indices were compared for a set of observatories with different climate characteristics, located in different parts of the world. Under global warming conditions, only the sc-PDSI and SPEI identified an increase in drought severity associated with higher water demand as a result of evapotranspiration. Relative to the sc-PDSI, the SPEI has the advantage of being multiscalar, which is crucial for drought analysis and monitoring. © 2010 American Meteorological Society.},

This version provides an improved estimation of interpolation uncertainty through the calculation of a 100-member ensemble of realizations of each daily field. The data set covers the period back to 1950 and provides gridded fields at a spacing of 0.25∘ × 0.25∘ in regular latitude/longitude coordinates. As with the original E-OBS data set, the ensemble version is based on the station series collated as part of the ECA\&D initiative. Station density varies significantly over the domain, and over time, and a reliable estimation of interpolation uncertainty in the gridded fields is therefore important for users of the data set. The uncertainty quantified by the ensemble data set is more realistic than the uncertainty estimates in the original version, although uncertainty is still underestimated in data-sparse regions. The new data set is compared against the earlier version of E-OBS and against regional gridded data sets produced by a selection of National Meteorological Services. In terms of both climatological averages and extreme values, the new version of E-OBS is broadly comparable to the earlier version. Nonetheless, users will notice differences between the two E-OBS versions, especially for precipitation, which arises from the different gridding method used.},

We evaluated the models on the basis of traditional logistic regression goodness-of-fit criteria including the; test, sensitivity, specificity, rate of correct classification, bias and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves with subsequent R-2. The interpretation of the fit measures appeared to be complicated. The ML and MQL methods resulted in models with high sensitivity, a high rate of correct classification and low bias. Despite the good fit measures, the Hosmer-Lemeshow test suggested rejection of the models. The graphical expression of the models' ROC curves did not give additional information to make a selection between any of the models, but the R-2 showed that the models obtained with the NIL and MQL methods were slightly better than that obtained with the PQL method.},

Data were supplied by the Forest Research Centre of the National Institute of Agricultural and Food Research (INIA) of Spain, consisting of a Permanent Sample Plot network (PSP) covering different stand conditions. In this study, 84 plots for Mediterranean maritime pine and 74 plots for Scots pine were used. Several models were tested. Variables concerning tree size, competition and social position of the tree were introduced in stepwise selection. The ratio diameter at breast height versus quadratic mean diameter and the interaction basal area-site index resulted as the most significant variables in the case of Mediterranean maritime pine. For Scots pine, the most significant variables were site index, DBH-1 and the interaction between basal area of larger trees and the coefficient of variation of the DBH distribution as a surrogate of structure. Results indicate that competition, tree size and social position within the stand are present in the survival process of both species. One-sided competition in highly structured stands for Scots pine and two-sided competition for Mediterranean maritime pine, are shown to be also important. Model evaluation has been done with data from the PSP not used in the fitting process. The area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve is 0.86 for Mediterranean maritime pine and 0.85 for Scots pine. The overall predicted rates of survival and mortality are shown for different cut-off points, indicating that the use of random uniform numbers yields better results. Afterwards, the performance of the model in thinned stands is tested for both species. Results for Mediterranean maritime pine show that it is appropriate to use the same model both for unthinned and thinned stands. However, a new model should be fitted for thinned Scots pine stands. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Competition plays an important role in stand dynamics, but the study of competition conducted in natural forests with complex structure and composition is still limited. The traditional methods, which quantify the competition between individual trees, commonly ignore the information of species identity and spatial distribution. This study introduced a new competition index named Structure-based Competition Index (designated as SCI), which was calculated according to the characteristics of neighborhood spatial structure. The effectiveness of the new index was tested by: (1) analyzing its correlation with the traditional competition indices (Hegyi and BAL); (2) comparing its performance in predicting tree growth with the traditional indices, and (3) analyzing the competition effect on tree mortality. The data were collected in two different aged natural forests located in the Jilin and Gansu provinces, China. Results showed that SCI was significantly correlated with the traditional competition indices. Basal area increment (BAI) was positively related to initial tree size, and negatively related to competition. Overall, the combination of tree size and competition explained 60.0–70.6\% of the total variance in BAI of trees in both sites. The BAI prediction models incorporating SCI as one explanatory variable showed better statistical performance than those including the traditional indices. The performance of traditional competition indices showed mixed results in differently aged forests: the Hegyi index performed better than the BAL index in old-growth forest, while the contrary result was found in secondary forest. In conclusion, SCI could be a useful indicator for assessing the competitive status of individual trees in natural forests. It was essential to consider the relative importance of tree size, competitive status and the species identity when analyzing tree growth and mortality in natural forests characterized by complex structure and composition.},

	abstract = {Background: Information about competition responses is mainly available for monospecific stands or mixed stands with a small number of species. Studies on complex multi-species and highly structured forest ecosystems are scarce. Accordingly, the objective of this study was to quantify competition effects and analyse competition responses in a species-diverse afrotemperate forest in South Africa, based on an observational study with mapped tree positions and long-term diameter increment records. Methods: The sensitivity to competition was analysed for individual species and involved the calculation of the slope of the linear relation between the value of a competition index (CI) and diameter growth as a measure of sensitivity. In a next step different competition indices were combined and tree diameters were grouped in three classes as surrogates for canopy status and ontogenetic stage. Results: Five competition indices were found to be effective in showing sensitivity to competition for a number of canopy and sub-canopy species. Significant linear regressions were fitted for 18 of a total of 25 species. Species reactions varied significantly in their sensitivity to the different CIs. The indices were classified as belonging to two groups, those that responded more to local crowding and those that are more sensitive to overtopping, which revealed species-specific sensitivities to both factors. The analysis based on diameter classes revealed that species clearly changed their sensitivity to crowding or overtopping depending on diameter. Canopy and sub-canopy species showed distinct differences in their reactions. Conclusions: The application of multiple CIs brought novel insights relating to the dynamics of afrotemperate forests. The response patterns to different competition indices that focus on crowding and overtopping are varied and tree diameter dependent, indicating that oversimplified assumptions are not warranted in the interpretation of CI-growth relations.},

	abstract = {Key message: Under severe drought, growth of Norway spruce suffered much more than European beech. Norway spruce benefited from growing in the environment of beech, and both species acclimated slightly to 5 years of experimentally extended drought. Abstract: Recent studies show that the detrimental effects of drought on stand growth are mitigated when the stand contains mixed tree species. We analysed the growth responses of Norway spruce and European beech to episodic and experimentally extended drought in intra- and inter-specific mature stands. We used annual diameter growth records dating back to 1998 to determine the impact of the natural episodic drought in 2003 and 2015. To analyse extended drought, spruce and beech trees were exposed to extreme drought under automatic throughfall exclusion roofs from 2014 to 2018. The growth of spruce in an inter-specific environment with beech was 20–50\% less affected by natural episodic drought compared with an intra-specific constellation. When beech grew in an inter-specific environment, it was by 23\% more affected by drought compared to intra-specific conditions, but seemed to recover faster. The induced drought from 2014 to 2018 resulted in a strong growth reduction in the first year particularly for spruce, followed by a slight acclimation to the dry conditions. Beech acclimated and recovered faster than spruce across all growing conditions, while spruce only acclimatized faster in the environment of beech. Both species showed a higher mortality under induced drought compared with the controls; for spruce, the mortality rate was fivefold higher compared to the long-term mortality. The long-term moderate-growth stabilization and the growth increase after the 5-year exposure to drought suggest a gradual acclimation to drought by beech. The resistance and acclimation to drought of spruce when growing in mixture should be considered when designing resource efficient and productive mixed conifer-broadleaved stands for future climates.},

	abstract = {The self-thinning rule established by Reineke in 1933, N d 1.605 (N, d number of stems and quadratic mean diameter, respectively) assumes the same allometric relationship between size and density for a wide spectrum of species under self-thinning conditions. We re-evaluate this rule based on 28 fully stocked pure stands of common beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst.), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), and common oak (Quercus petraea [Mattuschka] Liebl.) in Germany that date back to the year 1870. OLS regression of the model ln(N) a b ln(d) results in b values of 1.789 for common beech, 1.664 for Norway spruce, 1.593 for Scots pine, and 1.424 for common oak. The allometric coefficient for common beech differs significantly from the other species. There is also a significant difference between the b values of Norway spruce and common oak. Except for Scots pine, the above allometric coefficients deviate significantly (common beech) and close-to-significantly (Norway spruce, common oak) from the coefficient 1.605 postulated by Reineke in 1933. To cover the species-specific oscillation of mortality rates, we additionally calculate the self-thinning coefficient for each survey period. Ecological implications of the species-specific scaling exponents are stressed and consequences regarding tools for regulating stand density are discussed. FOR. SCI. 51(4):304-320. A S PLANTS GROW IN SIZE their demands on resources and growing space increase. If resources are no longer adequate for all stand components, self-thinning will be initiated and the number of plants (N) per unit area will decrease. The size-density allometry of plants under self-thinning is particularly informative under eco-physiological and production economics aspects because, under self-thinning conditions, size-density allometry reveals the species-specific, critical demand on resources and growing space of average trees at a given mean size. This article therefore focuses on the allometry between tree number per unit area N and quadratic mean diameter d (N d r). The allometric rules postulated by Reineke (1933) and Yoda et al. (1963) assume that the allometry between size and density is the same for a wide spectrum of species. Previous investigations tried to validate the rules from Yoda and Reineke for herbaceous and woody plants and usually relied on artificial time series or inventories (Harper 1977, Pretzsch 2002a, Weller 1987, 1990). By contrast, the present article proceeds from the hypothesis that size-density allometry is species-specific and may even be the essential reason for variations in the competitive powers of the main Central European tree species such as common beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst.), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), and common oak (Quercus petraea [Mattuschka] Liebl.). We agree with Baz-zaz and Grace (1997) that, if these species-specific differences are ignored, then the way toward a morphological -lometric understanding of the competitive mechanisms of tree species in pure and mixed stands will remain obstructed. The evaluation is based on real stem number-diameter time series in 28 fully stocked pure stands in Ger-many that date back to the year 1870. This unique database was used to answer the following questions: (1) Are there species-specific differences in the allometric coefficient b of the model ln(N) a b ln(d), (2) Do the calculated b values deviate significantly from the b value of 1.605 postulated by Reineke, and (3) Are any oscillations of the allometric constant r N/N d/d species-specific? Ecological implications of the individual species self-thinning process are stressed and consequences regarding tools for assessing, regulating, and scheduling stand density are discussed.},

This has resulted in more severe and frequent ecological disturbances to forest stands. This study analysed the size-dependence of growth response to drought years based on 384 tree individuals of Norway spruce [Picea abies (L.) Karst.] and European beech [Fagus sylvatica ([L.)] in Bavaria, Germany. Samples were collected in both monospecific and mixed-species stands. To quantify the growth response to drought stress, indices for basal area increment, resistance, recovery and resilience were calculated from tree ring measurements of increment cores. Linear mixed models were developed to estimate the influence of drought periods. The results show that ageing-related growth decline is significant in drought years. Drought resilience and resistance decrease significantly with growth size among Norway spruce individuals. Evidence is also provided for robustness in the resilience capacity of European beech during drought stress. Spruce benefits from species mixing with deciduous beech, with over-yielding spruce in pure stands. The importance of the influence of size-dependence within tree growth studies during disturbances is highlighted and should be considered in future studies of disturbances, including drought.},

	abstract = {Pulses of tree mortality caused by drought have been reported recently in forests around the globe, but large-scale quantitative evidence is lacking for Europe. Analyzing high-resolution annual satellite-based canopy mortality maps from 1987 to 2016 we here show that excess forest mortality (i.e., canopy mortality exceeding the long-term mortality trend) is significantly related to drought across continental Europe. The relationship between water availability and mortality showed threshold behavior, with excess mortality increasing steeply when the integrated climatic water balance from March to July fell below −1.6 standard deviations of its long-term average. For −3.0 standard deviations the probability of excess canopy mortality was 91.6\% (83.8–97.5\%). Overall, drought caused approximately 500,000 ha of excess forest mortality between 1987 and 2016 in Europe. We here provide evidence that drought is an important driver of tree mortality at the continental scale, and suggest that a future increase in drought could trigger widespread tree mortality in Europe. Droughts pose an increasingly important threat to forests. Here the authors analyse a high-resolution Landsat-based dataset of forest canopy mortality in Europe over 1987–2016 to show that drought is already a major driver of tree mortality.},

It relies on the assumption that the height of dominant trees in a stand is independent from the local density. However, research on climate change suggests that under certain moisture stress conditions, this may not hold. Here, based on 29 plots from five long-term research experiments, we tested the effect of local stand density on the SI of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst). With generalized additive models (GAMM), we analyzed the effect of stand structure and climate predictors on SI. The two evaluated models revealed that local stand density and age had a significant effect on SI (p ≤ 0.001), showing a clear negative trend especially significant on sites with poor and dry soils, which may reduce the SI by a maximum of approximately 4 m for an increase in density of between 400 and 600 trees/ha. We stress that the physiological characteristics of Norway spruce, flat-rooting system and xeromorphism, especially when growing in pure stands, may explain these effects. Thus, density control and growth in mixtures may help to reduce the water stress and losses in height growth under future climate conditions.},

Models were also used to predict mortality in future FIA inventories under the RCP 4.5 emissions scenario. Model performance indicated species identity as the most important predictor of mortality under both current and future scenarios, with contributions from climate and soil variables.

Past research has relied overwhelmingly on logistic regression analysis (LR) that predicts post-fire tree status as a binary outcome (i.e. living or dead). One of the most problematic issues for LR (or any classification problem) occurs when there is a class imbalance in the training data. In these instances, predictions will be biased toward the majority class. Using a historical prescribed fire data set of longleaf pines (Pinus palustris) from northern Florida, USA, we compare results from standard LR and the machine-learning algorithm, random forest (RF). First, we demonstrate the class imbalance problem using simulated data. We then show how a balanced RF model can be used to alleviate the bias in the model and improve mortality prediction results. In the simulated example, LR model sensitivity and specificity was clearly biased based on the degree of imbalance between the classes. The balanced RF models had consistent sensitivity and specificity throughout the simulated data sets. Re-analyzing the original longleaf pine data set with a balanced RF model showed that although both LR and RF models had similar areas under the receiver operating curve (AUC), the RF model had better discrimination for predicting new observations of dead trees. Both LR and RF models identified duff consumption and percent crown scorch as important predictors of tree mortality, however the RF model also suggested pre-fire duff depth as an important predictor. Our analysis highlights LR limitations when data are imbalanced and supports using RF to develop post-fire tree mortality models. We suggest how RF can be incorporated into future tree mortality studies, as well as possible implementation in future decision-support tools.},

	abstract = {Tree survival and mortality play a critical role in forest ecosystems. Being able to predict the survival probability provides significant insights into forest management decision support. In this study, we employed an artificial neural network (ANN) to predict tree survival and mortality in an Oriental beech (Fagus orientalis Lipsky) forest in northern Iran, using long-term data and wide range of biotic (average tree diameter increment, and basal area in larger trees (BAL)) and abiotic variables (slope, average solar radiation during the growing season, wind velocity and direction, height above the nearest drainage point, topographic wetness index, temperature, and relative humidity). The ANN model revealed that the greatest survival rates belong to the trees with diameter {\textbackslash}textgreater20–100 cm. An increase in competition leads to reduced survival, and the Carpinus betulus species showed a slightly lower survival rate than the other species. Further, our findings demonstrated that BAL and diameter increment have a strong correlation with the probability of tree survival in the study area. The ANN performance was evaluated using the R2 and RMSE metrics and compared to a multiple logistic regression that demonstrated the capability of the ANN model for the prediction of survival probability (R2 = 0.92; RMSE = 0.985). From these results, we recommend the employment of ANN, and perhaps other machine learning methods, for the prediction of survival probability in many different ecosystems around the world.},

	abstract = {Forest parameters have been estimated using various regression methods based on satellite data. However, there are a few concerns regarding further application of these predicted parameters. Current forest quality (FQ) assessments are mainly based on forest parameters collected in the field. To evaluate FQ quickly and comprehensively, forest parameters estimated from satellite images can be used. Black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) plantations have experienced increases in tree mortality and reductions in tree growth caused by human destruction and poor natural conditions on the Loess Plateau. Assessing the FQ of the black locust plantations in these areas is critical. In this study, four machine learning algorithms (MLAs) – classification and regression tree (CART), support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN) and random forest (RF) – were first implemented and compared regarding their ability to estimate forest parameters of black locust plantations on the Loess Plateau. The results indicated that among the four MLAs, the CART method achieved the lowest accuracy, the SVM and ANN methods had moderate performances, and the RF obtained the highest accuracy and lowest error for all forest parameter estimates. As a result, the RF algorithm was chosen to predict the forest parameters. The highest R2 values among the forest parameters were predicted for the diameter at breast height (DBH, R2 = 0.85 and relative root mean square error (rRMSE) = 0.18), and the lowest R2 values were predicted for the forest aboveground biomass (AGB, R2 = 0.66 and rRMSE = 0.25). These predicted forest parameters as well as the topographic factors derived from a digital elevation model (DEM) were used to assess the FQ of the study area. Among the four stand age classes, the middle-aged forest had the lowest proportion of poor quality forests (7\%) and the highest proportion of good quality forests (52\%), whereas overmature forests presented a moderate proportion of poor quality forests (23\%) and good quality forests (21\%). These results provide the necessary foundation for forest management and guidance for regional reforestation on the Loess Plateau.},

	abstract = {Modeling individual trees in tropical rain forests in the Amazon allows for the safe use of scarce resources in a sustainable way. Unfortunately, in the Brazilian Amazon, rain forest growth and production models are not yet used to estimate future forest stock. Thus, forest management plans do not present technical-scientific support that guarantees sustainable production of wood throughout the cutting cycle. Therefore, this work aims to estimate the survival and mortality of individual trees in a selectively harvested forest using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to support silvicultural decisions in forest management in the Amazon rain forest. In 1979, a selective harvest was carried out, with 72.5 m3 ha-1 in an area of 64 ha in Floresta Nacional do Tapajós, in the state of Pará, Brazil. In 1981, 36 permanent plots were installed at random and inventoried. Nine successive measurements were carried from 1982 to 2012. In the modeling, classification, survival, and mortality, training and ANN testing were performed, using input variables such as: different semi-distance-independent competition indices (DSICI), diameter measured (dbh), forest class (FC), trunk identification class (TIC), competition index (CI), growth groups (GG), liana infestation intensity (liana); and crown lighting (CL); Damage to tree (D) and tree rotting (R). The categorical output variables (Classification) were Dead or Surviving tree. Overall efficiency of the classification was above 89\% in training and above 90\% in the test for all ANNs. Survival classification hit rate was above 99\% in the test and training for all ANNs but the mortality score was low, with hit rates below 6\%. The overall Kappa coefficient was below 8\% for all ANNs (ranked “poor”) but all ANNs were above 55\% in the survival classification (ranked “good”). ANN estimates the individual survival of trees more accurately but this does not occur with mortality, which is a rarer event than survival.},

	abstract = {Binary classifiers are routinely evaluated with performance measures such as sensitivity and specificity, and performance is frequently illustrated with Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) plots. Alternative measures such as positive predictive value (PPV) and the associated Precision/Recall (PRC) plots are used less frequently. Many bioinformatics studies develop and evaluate classifiers that are to be applied to strongly imbalanced datasets in which the number of negatives outweighs the number of positives significantly. While ROC plots are visually appealing and provide an overview of a classifier's performance across a wide range of specificities, one can ask whether ROC plots could be misleading when applied in imbalanced classification scenarios. We show here that the visual interpretability of ROC plots in the context of imbalanced datasets can be deceptive with respect to conclusions about the reliability of classification performance, owing to an intuitive but wrong interpretation of specificity. PRC plots, on the other hand, can provide the viewer with an accurate prediction of future classification performance due to the fact that they evaluate the fraction of true positives among positive predictions. Our findings have potential implications for the interpretation of a large number of studies that use ROC plots on imbalanced datasets.},

	abstract = {Background In plants, RNA editing is a process that converts specific cytidines to uridines and uridines to cytidines in transcripts from virtually all mitochondrial protein-coding genes. There are thousands of plant mitochondrial genes in the sequence databases, but sites of RNA editing have not been determined for most. Accurate methods of RNA editing site prediction will be important in filling in this information gap and could reduce or even eliminate the need for experimental determination of editing sites for many sequences. Because RNA editing tends to increase protein conservation across species by "correcting" codons that specify unconserved amino acids, this principle can be used to predict editing sites by identifying positions where an RNA editing event would increase the conservation of a protein to homologues from other plants. PREP-Mt takes this approach to predict editing sites for any protein-coding gene in plant mitochondria. Results To test the general applicability of the PREP-Mt methodology, RNA editing sites were predicted for 370 full-length or nearly full-length DNA sequences and then compared to the known sites of RNA editing for these sequences. Of 60,263 cytidines in this test set, PREP-Mt correctly classified 58,994 as either an edited or unedited site (accuracy = 97.9\%). PREP-Mt properly identified 3,038 of the 3,698 known sites of RNA editing (sensitivity = 82.2\%) and 55,956 of the 56,565 known unedited sites (specificity = 98.9\%). Accuracy and sensitivity increased to 98.7\% and 94.7\%, respectively, after excluding the 489 silent editing sites (which have no effect on protein sequence or function) from the test set. Conclusion These results indicate that PREP-Mt is effective at identifying C to U RNA editing sites in plant mitochondrial protein-coding genes. Thus, PREP-Mt should be useful in predicting protein sequences for use in molecular, biochemical, and phylogenetic analyses. In addition, PREP-Mt could be used to determine functionality of a mitochondrial gene or to identify particular sequences with unusual editing properties. The PREP-Mt methodology should be applicable to any system where RNA editing increases protein conservation across species.},

However, many different measures have been defined in the literature with the aim of making better choices in general or for a specific application area.

In this work, we analyse experimentally the behaviour of 18 different performance metrics in several scenarios, identifying clusters and relationships between measures. We also perform a sensitivity analysis for all of them in terms of several traits: class threshold choice, separability/ranking quality, calibration performance and sensitivity to changes in prior class distribution. From the definitions and experiments, we make a comprehensive analysis of the relationships between metrics, and a taxonomy and arrangement of them according to the previous traits. This can be useful for choosing the most adequate measure (or set of measures) for a specific application. Additionally, the study also highlights some niches in which new measures might be defined and also shows that some supposedly innovative measures make the same choices (or almost) as existing ones. Finally, this work can also be used as a reference for comparing experimental results in pattern recognition and machine learning literature, when using different measures.},

Within the amino terminal half of the molecule the locations of helices predicted by a number of methods agree moderately well with the observed structure, however within the carboxyl half of the molecule the overall agreement is poor. For eleven different helix predictions, the coefficients giving the correlation between prediction and observation range from 0.14 to 0.42. The accuracy of the predictions for both β-sheet regions and for turns are generally lower than for the helices, and in a number of instances the agreement between prediction and observation is no better than would be expected for a random selection of residues. The structural predictions for T4 phage lysozyme are much less successful than was the case for adenylate kinase (Schulz et al. (1974) Nature 250, 140–142). No one method of prediction is clearly superior to all others, and although empirical predictions based on larger numbers of known protein structure tend to be more accurate than those based on a limited sample, the improvement in accuracy is not dramatic, suggesting that the accuracy of current empirical predictive methods will not be substantially increased simply by the inclusion of more data from additional protein structure determinations.},

The LANDIS model of forest landscape disturbance and succession was developed since the early 1990s as a research and management tool that optimizes the possible landscape extent (100sha to 1000skm2), while providing mechanistic detail adequate for a broad range of potential problems. LANDIS is a raster model, and operates on landscapes mapped as cells, containing tree species age classes. Spatial processes, such as seed dispersal, and disturbances such as fire, wind, and harvesting can occur. LANDIS development benefited from the modelling and research progress of the 1960s to the1980s, including the growth of landscape ecology during the 1980s. In the past decade the model has been used by colleagues across North America, as well as in Europe and China. This has been useful to those not able to undertake the cost and effort of developing their own model, and it has provided a growing diverse set of test landscapes for the model. These areas include temperate, southern, and boreal forests of eastern North America, to montane and boreal western forests, coastal California forest and shrub systems, boreal Finnish forests, and montane forests in Switzerland and northeastern China. The LANDIS model continues to be refined and developed. Papers in this special issue document recent work. Future goals include integration within a larger land use change model, and applications to landscape and regional global change projection based on newly incorporated biomass and carbon dynamics.},

	abstract = {Large uncertainties characterize forest development under global climate change. Although recent studies have found widespread increased tree mortality, the patterns and processes associated with tree death remain poorly understood, thus restricting accurate mortality predictions. Yet, projections of future forest dynamics depend critically on robust mortality models, preferably based on empirical data rather than theoretical, not well-constrained assumptions. We developed parsimonious mortality models for individual beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) trees and evaluated their potential for incorporation in dynamic vegetation models (DVMs). We used inventory data from nearly 19,000 trees from unmanaged forests in Switzerland, Germany, and Ukraine, representing the largest dataset used to date for calibrating such models. Tree death was modelled as a function of size and growth, i.e., stem diameter (dbh) and relative basal area increment (relBAI), using generalized logistic regression accounting for unequal re-measurement intervals. To explain the spatial and temporal variability in mortality patterns, we considered a large set of environmental and stand characteristics. Validation with independent datasets was performed to assess model generality. Our results demonstrate strong variability in beech mortality that was independent of environmental or stand characteristics. Mortality patterns in Swiss and German strict forest reserves were dominated by competition processes as indicated by J-shaped mortality over tree size and growth. The Ukrainian primeval beech forest was additionally characterized by windthrow and a U-shaped size–mortality function. Unlike the mortality model based on Ukrainian data, the Swiss and German models achieved good discrimination and acceptable transferability when validated against each other. We thus recommend these two models to be incorporated and examined in DVMs. Their mortality predictions respond to climate change via tree growth, which is sufficient to capture the adverse effects of water availability and competition on the mortality probability of beech under current conditions.},

We systematically analyzed the performance of 46 inventory-based mortality models available from the literature using nearly 80 000 independent records from 54 strict forest reserves in Germany and Switzerland covering 11 species. Mortality rates were predicted with higher accuracy if covariates for tree growth and (or) competition at the individual level were included and if models were applied within the same ecological zone. In contrast, classification of dead vs. living trees was only improved by growth variables. Management intensity in the calibration stands, as well as the census interval and size of the calibration datasets, did not influence model performance. Consequently, future approaches should make use of tree growth and competition at the level of individual trees. Mortality algorithms for applications over a restricted spatial extent and under current climate should be calibrated based on datasets from the same region, even if they are small. To obtain models with wide applicability and enhanced climatic sensitivity, the spatial variability of mortality should be addressed explicitly by considering environmental influences using data of high temporal resolution covering large ecological gradients. Finally, such models need to be validated and documented thoroughly.},

	abstract = {Forest succession depends strongly on the life history strategies of individual trees. An important strategic element is the ability to survive unfavourable environmental conditions that result in strongly reduced tree growth. In this study, we investigated whether the relationship between growth and mortality differs among tree species and site conditions. We analysed 10 329 trees of nine tree species (Picea abies, Taxus baccata, Fagus sylvatica, Tilia cordata, Carpinus betulus, Fraxinus excelsior, Quercus robur, Betula spp. and Alnus glutinosa) from unmanaged forests of Europe: the continental Białowieża forest (Poland) and several oceanically influenced Swiss forest reserves. For each species, we calculated a set of flexible logistic regression models with the explanatory variables growth (as measured by relative basal area increment), tree size and site. We selected the species-specific model with the highest goodness-of-fit and calculated its discriminatory power (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, AUC) and calibration measures. Most models achieved at least a good discriminatory power (AUC{\textgreater}0.7) and the AUC ranged from 0.62 to 0.87; calibration curves did not indicate any overfitting. Almost all growth–mortality relationships differed among species and sites, i.e. there is no universal growth–mortality relationship. Some species such as F. excelsior showed reduced survival probabilities for both unfavourable and very good growth conditions. We conclude that the growth–mortality relationships presented here can contribute to the life-history classification of trees and that they should also help to improve projections of forest succession models.},

            Models are pivotal for assessing future forest dynamics under the impacts of changing climate and management practices, incorporating representations of tree growth, mortality, and regeneration. Quantitative studies on the importance of mortality submodels are scarce. We evaluated 15 dynamic vegetation models (DVMs) regarding their sensitivity to different formulations of tree mortality under different degrees of climate change. The set of models comprised eight DVMs at the stand scale, three at the landscape scale, and four typically applied at the continental to global scale. Some incorporate empirically derived mortality models, and others are based on experimental data, whereas still others are based on theoretical reasoning. Each DVM was run with at least two alternative mortality submodels. Model behavior was evaluated against empirical time series data, and then, the models were subjected to different scenarios of climate change. Most DVMs matched empirical data quite well, irrespective of the mortality submodel that was used. However, mortality submodels that performed in a very similar manner against past data often led to sharply different trajectories of forest dynamics under future climate change. Most DVMs featured high sensitivity to the mortality submodel, with deviations of basal area and stem numbers on the order of 10–40\% per century under current climate and 20–170\% under climate change. The sensitivity of a given DVM to scenarios of climate change, however, was typically lower by a factor of two to three. We conclude that (1) mortality is one of the most uncertain processes when it comes to assessing forest response to climate change, and (2) more data and a better process understanding of tree mortality are needed to improve the robustness of simulated future forest dynamics. Our study highlights that comparing several alternative mortality formulations in DVMs provides valuable insights into the effects of process uncertainties on simulated future forest dynamics.},

	abstract = {Dynamic Vegetation Models (DVMs) are designed to be suitable for simulating forest succession and species range dynamics under current and future conditions based on mathematical representations of the three key processes regeneration, growth, and mortality. However, mortality formulations in DVMs are typically coarse and often lack an empirical basis, which increases the uncertainty of projections of future forest dynamics and hinders their use for developing adaptation strategies to climate change. Thus, sound tree mortality models are highly needed. We developed parsimonious, species-specific mortality models for 18 European tree species using {\textgreater}90,000 records from inventories in Swiss and German strict forest reserves along a considerable environmental gradient. We comprehensively evaluated model performance and incorporated the new mortality functions in the dynamic forest model ForClim. Tree mortality was successfully predicted by tree size and growth. Only a few species required additional covariates in their final model to consider aspects of stand structure or climate. The relationships between mortality and its predictors reflect the indirect influences of resource availability and tree vitality, which are further shaped by species-specific attributes such as maximum longevity and shade tolerance. Considering that the behavior of the models was biologically meaningful, and that their performance was reasonably high and not impacted by changes in the sampling design, we suggest that the mortality algorithms developed here are suitable for implementation and evaluation in DVMs. In the DVM ForClim, the new mortality functions resulted in simulations of stand basal area and species composition that were generally close to historical observations. However, ForClim performance was poorer than when using the original, coarse mortality formulation. The difficulties of simulating stand structure and species composition, which were most evident for Fagus sylvatica L. and in long-term simulations, resulted from feedbacks between simulated growth and mortality as well as from extrapolation to very small and very large trees. Growth and mortality processes and their species-specific differences should thus be revisited jointly, with a particular focus on small and very large trees in relation to their shade tolerance.},

Empirical mortality algorithms (MAs) are often considered promising, but little is known about DVM robustness when employing MAs of various structures and origins for multiple species. We analysed empirical MAs for a suite of European tree species within a consistent DVM framework under present and future climates in two climatically different study areas in Switzerland and evaluated their performance using empirical data from old-growth forests across Europe. DVM projections under present climate showed substantial variations when using alternative empirical MAs for the same species. Under climate change, DVM projections showed partly contrasting mortality responses for the same species. These opposing patterns were associated with MA structures (i.e. explanatory variables) and occurred independent of species ecological characteristics. When comparing simulated forest structure with data from old-growth forests, we found frequent overestimations of basal area, which can lead to flawed projections of carbon sequestration and other ecosystem services. While using empirical MAs in DVMs may appear promising, our results emphasize the importance of selecting them cautiously. We therefore synthesize our insights into a guideline for the appropriate use of empirical MAs in DVM applications.},

              BACKGROUND
              
                Forest dynamics arise from the interplay of chronic drivers and transient disturbances with the demographic processes of recruitment, growth, and mortality. The resulting trajectories of vegetation development drive the biomass and species composition of terrestrial ecosystems. Forest dynamics are changing because of anthropogenic-driven exacerbation of chronic drivers, such as rising temperature and CO
                2
                , and increasing transient disturbances, including wildfire, drought, windthrow, biotic attack, and land-use change. There are widespread observations of increasing tree mortality due to changing climate and land use, as well as observations of growth stimulation of younger forests due to CO
                2
                fertilization. These antagonistic processes are co-occurring globally, leaving the fate of future forests uncertain. We examine the implications of changing forest demography and its drivers for both future forest management and forecasting impacts of global climate forcing.
              
            
            
              ADVANCES
              
                We reviewed the literature of forest demographic responses to chronic drivers and transient disturbances to generate hypotheses on future trajectories of these factors and their subsequent impacts on vegetation dynamics, with a focus on forested ecosystems. We complemented this review with analyses of global land-use change and disturbance datasets to independently evaluate the implications of changing drivers and disturbances on global-scale tree demographics. Ongoing changes in environmental drivers and disturbance regimes are consistently increasing mortality and forcing forests toward shorter-statured and younger stands, reducing potential carbon storage. Acclimation, adaptation, and migration may partially mitigate these effects. These increased forest impacts are due to natural disturbances (e.g., wildfire, drought, windthrow, insect or pathogen outbreaks) and land-use change, both of which are predicted to increase in magnitude in the future. Atmospherically derived estimates of the terrestrial carbon sink and remote sensing data indicate that tree growth and potentially recruitment may have increased globally in the 20th century, but the growth of this carbon sink has slowed. Variability in growth stimulation due to CO
                2
                fertilization is evident globally, with observations and experiments suggesting that forests benefit from CO
                2
                primarily in early stages of secondary succession. Furthermore, increased tree growth typically requires sufficient water and nutrients to take advantage of rising CO
                2
                . Collectively, the evidence reveals that it is highly likely that tree mortality rates will continue to increase, whereas recruitment and growth will respond to changing drivers in a spatially and temporally variable manner. The net impact will be a reduction in forest canopy cover and biomass.
              
            
            
              OUTLOOK
              Pervasive shifts in forest vegetation dynamics are already occurring and are likely to accelerate under future global changes, with consequences for biodiversity and climate forcing. This conclusion is robust with respect to the abundant literature evidence and our global assessment of historical demographic changes, but it also forms the basis for hypotheses regarding the patterns and processes underlying the shifts in forest dynamics. These hypotheses will be directly testable using emerging terrestrial and satellite-based observation networks. The existing evidence and newly made observations provide a critical test of Earth system models that continue to improve in their ability to simulate forest dynamics and resulting climate forcing. Ultimately, forest managers and natural resource policies must confront the consequences of changing climate and disturbance regimes to ensure sustainable forests and accrue their associated benefits.

                    In the far-left panel, a mature ecosystem is responsive primarily to localized mortality, and the primary drivers of demography are chronically changing variables such as CO
                    2
                    , temperature, and vapor pressure deficit (VPD). In the next panel, the system is disturbed by fire, insect outbreak, or another large-scale perturbation that removes most of the overstory trees, and species adapted to rapid postdisturbance recruitment become established. In the third panel, recruitment and growth dominate demographic processes, with mortality increasing over time as competition leads to self-thinning. In the last panel, a mature ecosystem is dominated by species that have replaced the original community in response to chronic environmental changes, leading to a novel ecosystem.
                  
                
                
              
            
          , 
            Forest dynamics arise from the interplay of environmental drivers and disturbances with the demographic processes of recruitment, growth, and mortality, subsequently driving biomass and species composition. However, forest disturbances and subsequent recovery are shifting with global changes in climate and land use, altering these dynamics. Changes in environmental drivers, land use, and disturbance regimes are forcing forests toward younger, shorter stands. Rising carbon dioxide, acclimation, adaptation, and migration can influence these impacts. Recent developments in Earth system models support increasingly realistic simulations of vegetation dynamics. In parallel, emerging remote sensing datasets promise qualitatively new and more abundant data on the underlying processes and consequences for vegetation structure. When combined, these advances hold promise for improving the scientific understanding of changes in vegetation demographics and disturbances.},

	abstract = {Question What are the drivers of structural changes and mortality in oak–beech forests over 50 yrs of natural succession? Location Twelve unmanaged forest sites, comprising a large environmental gradient in the Swiss lowlands. Method By using repeated inventory data from more than 17 600 individually tagged trees, the dynamics of oak–beech stands over the past 50 yrs were analysed. Generalized linear mixed-effects models were fitted to quantify annual mortality rates of oak and beech based on DBH, stand basal area, precipitation and slope. Results Stand basal area increased, whereas tree density decreased over time. At most sites, the relative importance of oak decreased gradually compared to beech. Mortality increased over time for both oak and beech, but the increase was stronger for oak. Oak and beech mortality decreased with increasing DBH and tended to increase with precipitation. Additionally, oak mortality increased with stand basal area, whereas no such trend was found for beech. Conclusion Our study indicates that mortality in Central European oak–beech forests is driven by a combination of stand structures (i.e. tree size and stand basal area) and climate. However, the influence of climate on oak mortality is comparably low. Increasing oak mortality with stand basal area is a plausible consequence of its lower relative competitiveness and higher demand for light. Thus, in forests developing towards higher stand basal area, the ecologically important oak is increasingly outcompeted by beech, unless competition is reduced through management or disturbances.},

The estimated rate is not independent of the census period. 2 An average rate estimate will decrease with time if the sample population cannot be characterized as homogeneous. This artefact may have considerable significance for comparisons between permanent plot studies that have used different census periods. 3 We present a theoretical consideration of this census effect. The artefact will be severe when a fraction of the population has a very much higher mortality rate than the average. 4 Using a simple formulation we provide a mathematical proof that rate estimates will decline with increasing census periods for all but perfectly uniform populations. 5 The phenomenon of apparent rate decrease may be used to provide ecologically significant information about the diversity and dynamics of the population as it is related to the variance of life expectancies within the sample. 6 Such an artefact complicates evaluation of change over nonstandard time intervals and requires careful and detailed attention. Similar problems will effect any estimation procedure which cannot account for all the rate variation within a study population. Recognition of the problem is a necessary first step.},

Consequently, CVD has become a global health problem, and timely diagnosis is essential (WHO, 2021). Screening for risk factors accelerates the diagnosis and management of CVD, resulting in a more effective and rapid response, reducing the risk of death. This article compares six classification models, AdaBoost, Random Forest, Decision Tree, KNN, Naive Bayes, and Perceptron, to predict CVD symptoms. Based on CDC data collected from Kaggle, classification models were compared with the approach of examining effective factors to predict heart disease. Since the data set was imbalanced, the study performance was measured by AUC and F1-score in Class 1, which is the critical class in this dataset. AdaBoost is found to have the highest AUC and F1-score, respectively, of 0.828 and 0.37, while Decision Tree has the lowest AUC of 0.595 and F1-score of 0.25.},

The results stated that NB and RF models’ performance has not improved with the resampling methods, while KNN has significantly improved across all metrics.

We observed high classification accuracy in all applications as measured by cross-validation and, in the case of the lichen data, by independent test data, when comparing RF to other common classification methods.

	abstract = {Tree mortality shapes forest development, but rising mortality can represent lost production or an adverse response to changing environmental conditions. Thinning represents a strategy for reducing mortality rates, but different thinning techniques and intensities could have varying impacts depending on how they alter stand structure. We analyzed trends in stand structure, relative density, stand-scale mortality, climate, and correlations between mortality and climate over 46 years of thinning treatments in a red pine forest in Northern Minnesota, USA to examine how thinning techniques that remove trees of different crown classes interact with growing stock manipulation to impact patterns of tree mortality. Relative density in unharvested plots increased during the first 25 years of the study to around 80\%, then began to plateau, but was lower (12–62\%) in thinned stands. Mortality in unharvested plots claimed 2.5 times more stems yr−1 and 8.6 times as large a proportion of annual biomass increment during the last 21 years of the study compared to the first 25 years, but showed few temporal trends in thinned stands. Mortality in thinning treatments was generally lower than in controls, particularly during the last 21 years of the study when mortality averaged about 0.1\% of stems yr−1 and 4\% of biomass increment across thinning treatments, but 0.8\% of stems yr−1 and 49\% of biomass increment in unharvested plots. Treatments that combined thinning from above with low growing stock levels represented an exception, where mortality exceeded biomass production after initial thinning. Mortality averaged less than 0.1\% of stems yr−1 and less than 1\% of annual biomass production in stands thinned from below. These trends suggest thinning from below minimizes mortality across a wide range of growing stock levels while thinning from above to low growing stock levels can result in dramatic short-term increases in mortality. Moderate to high growing stock levels (21–34m2ha−1) may offer greater flexibility for limiting mortality across a range of thinning methods. Mean and maximum annual and growing season temperatures rose by 0.6–1.8°C during the study, and temperature variables were positively correlated with mortality in unharvested plots. Mortality increases in unharvested plots, however, were consistent with self-thinning principles and probably not driven by rising temperatures. These results suggest interactions between thinning method and intensity influence mortality reductions associated with thinning, and demonstrate the need for broader consideration of developmental processes as potential explanations for increased tree mortality rates in recent decades.},

Based on a subset of 189 plots in Scots pine (the most widespread tree species in Europe) and high-resolution climate data, we identified clear large-regional differences; growth is strongly increasing in Northern Europe and decreasing in the Southwest. A less pronounced increase, which is probably not mainly driven by climate, prevails on large areas of Western, Central and Eastern Europe. The identified regional growth trends suggest adaptive management on regional level for achieving climate-smart forests.},

Forestry planning and climate change scenarios are based on similar (long-term) timescales, i.e. between 70 and 120 yr. Within the EU project ‘Modelling the Impact of Climate Extremes’ (MICE), we have used ‘present day’ runs (1961–1990) and future scenarios (2070–2100, emission scenarios A2 and B2 from the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios [SRES]) of the HadRM3 regional climate model to study and model direct and indirect effects of changing climate on Norway spruce in Sweden and northern Europe. According to our results, extreme climate events like spring temperature backlashes and summer drought will increase in frequency and duration. In combination with a raised mean temperature, climate extremes will negatively precondition trees (i.e. increase their susceptibility) to secondary damage through pests and pathogens. Decreased forest vitality also makes stands more susceptible to windthrow. Storm damage is discussed based on a 100 yr storm damage record for Sweden. Marginally increased frequencies and windspeeds of storms may cause disproportionate increases in windthrow. Increased economic hazards can be expected from a combination of the increased volumes of wind-thrown timber, and a greater likelihood of additional generations of spruce bark beetle Ips typographus (further encouraged by the increase in fallen timber), as a result of a changing climate with warmer summers.},

	abstract = {Even-aged stands can regenerate with many thousand seedlings per hectare before the density declines to just a few hundred trees per hectare 100 years later; management practices can lead to even lower tree numbers due to quality selection and thinning. In other words, during the development of unmanaged stands, the majority of individuals die naturally due to competition. Despite the far-reaching consequences for structural and genetic diversity, dead wood and fuel wood accumulation, we have only limited quantitative knowledge about the continuous mortality of trees and the wood volume loss over longer timespans. For this study, we used a unique set of 476 unmanaged, monospecific experimental plots of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst.), silver fir (Abies alba Mill.), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), European larch (Larix decidua Mill.), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco)), European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), and oak (Quercus robur L. and Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl.) throughout Europe to analyze the competition-based mortality of trees and its dependency on age and site conditions. First, we show that the total stem volume production, standing stock, and mortality were continuously increasing until an age of 100–150 years. The accumulated competition-caused stem volume loss at that age amounted to 500–1000 m3 ha−1. Second, the net growth of the stands (share of the growth that is accumulated in the standing stock) strongly decreased with increasing age even when the gross growth was still high. The proportion of the net growth versus gross growth continuously decreased with increasing age regardless of site quality. Third, we show a degressive decrease of the annual relative tree number mortality rates from 0.05 to 0.20 in young down to 0.01–0.02 in mature stands. For some species, we found these rates to be site dependent with different directions of the site effect. The interplay of decreasing mortality rates and increasing average volume of the dead trees resulted in unimodal mortality curves over time of the annual mortality, peaking at 3–12 m3 ha−1 yr−1 at ages of about 75–150 years. Over the whole rotation, the average annual biomass loss from mortality ranged between 0.8 and 2.1 t ha−1 yr−1 with a carbon content of 0.4–1.1 t C ha−1 yr−1. We discuss the relevance of the results for measuring, understanding, modelling, and managing forest stands. Our results reveal that the withdrawal of forest management and setting aside (previously managed) forests over a rotation time of 100–150 years means that about one third of the total production in monospecific stands would flow to the debris pool rather than being exploited for carbon sequestration and related emission savings in harvested wood products. The mortality related loss fractions of above ground biomass we quantified in this study indicate the trade-off between wood production and setting aside forest to allow deadwood accumulation and associate changes in biodiversity.},

	abstract = {Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148–156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

The release of the Norway's International Climate \& Forests Initiative (NICFI) Planet tropical basemaps time-series starting in 2015 at a 4.77-m resolution represents a unique opportunity to forecast climate change consequences such as drought episodes. Using multi-temporal ground surveys over 144 plots and publicly available high-resolution Planet dove time-series imagery we evaluate forest mortality patterns driven by imaging spectroscopy methods in Mato Grosso (Brazil) over an area planted with eucalypts severely affected by the 2019 drought. Changes in vegetation indexes before and after the 2019 drought were modelled using the effective logistic regression modelling to explain variation in tree mortality between the surveys, the dependent variable. We aimed to straightforwardly model tree mortality using change vectors in Planet's image mosaics co-registering in time with the observed tree mortality measurements in the field. The results showed differences in Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as the most significant predictor variable under the effective logistic regression modelling performed. The efficacy of 80.98\% in concordance pairs correctly classified represented 0.81 of area under the Receiver Operating Curve (ROC). The release of the 2015–2020 Planet imagery in the tropics at 4.77-m resolution represents a valuable dataset to better understand previous natural disturbances and a powerful technology to detect in advance, and monthly after September 2020, eucalypt areas prone to harmful and increasingly frequent water-stress episodes.},

	abstract = {California’s high density, fire-excluded forests experienced an extreme drought accompanied by warmer than normal temperatures from 2012 to 2015, resulting in the deaths of millions of trees. We examined tree mortality and growth of mixed-conifer stands that had been experimentally treated between 2011 and 2013 with two different thinning treatments, one with more structural variability (HighV) and one with less structural variability (LowV), applied alone or in combination with prescribed burning. Tree mortality between 2014 and 2018 varied by species ranging from 42\% of white fir (Abies concolor) to 18\% of sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana), 12\% of incense cedar (Calocedrus decurrens) and 10\% of yellow pine (P. ponderosa and P. jeffreyi). Lower overall tree mortality rates at this location relative to drier locations in the southern Sierra Nevada suggested that drought effects may have been ameliorated by lower water deficits due to our site’s more northerly location and deep, productive soils in combination with reductions in tree competition following thinning and burning. Averaged across burn treatments, thinning reduced the overall mortality rate between 2014 and 2018 from 34\% to 11\%. A total of 23\% of the basal area was lost in the unthinned control treatments during this time period, while basal area was unchanged in the thinned treatments, with growth offsetting mortality. There was no significant difference in mortality or basal area change between LowV and HighV, suggesting that leaving trees at variable spacing may not compromise growth or resilience of the stand during a drought. Overall tree mortality was greater in the prescribed burn treatments, most pronounced in the smaller tree size classes, and varied by species, with burning having a significant effect on incense cedar and all pines, but not white fir. Trees with greater competition (Hegyi index) were more likely to die, particularly when also burned. Burning, however, consumed surface fuels and lowered fire hazard. With predictions of warmer droughts and greater weather variability, reducing forest density (basal area) and keeping surface fuel loads low will be important for building greater resilience to future drought stress and wildfire.},

	abstract = {Tree mortality is an important process during forest succession, influencing forest structure, composition, and ecosystem services. Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata (Lamb.) Hook.), a native and fast growing species with high quality timber, is widely planted in southern China. Yet the mechanisms leading to tree mortality of Chinese fir plantations under climate change conditions is still not clearly understood. A long-term spacing trial including 60 permanent plots located in Fujian, Jiangxi, Guangxi, and Sichuan provinces in southern China were used to explore tree mortality in relation to competition, age, structural diversity, and climatic variables using a logistic mixed effects model. Results showed that tree mortality increased with increasing LnN (natural logarithm of number of trees per ha), tree density index (TN), Gini coefficient, age (A), LnAP (natural logarithm of annual precipitation), and mean warmest month temperature, and decreased with increasing relative density (RD), inverse of diameter (1/D), and mean annual temperature. The relative contributions of competition, age and structure variables to mortality were 88.82\%, much larger than climate variables 11.18\%. In addition, in view of the contributions of stand factors, competition indices including RD, LnN, TN were 50.57\%, much larger than age (A, 1/D) contribution of 37.45\%, and structural diversity contribution of 0.80\%, which indicated that competition was the main driver of tree mortality. Our findings highlight the mechanisms of tree mortality of Chinese fir in southern China under climate change.},

	abstract = {Tree mortality is a critical ecological phenomenon shaping forest ecosystem dynamics, structure, and composition, while its effects are of global relevance due to its relationship with forest conditions and environmental changes. There are several challenges associated with individual-based mortality data, particularly observations with uneven measurement intervals. Here, we develop and examine several common individual-based mortality modelling strategies that simultaneously account for unequal measurement lengths and the hierarchical structure of the data in long-term, permanent plot data from the mixed Nothofagus forests in south-central Chile. These strategies depend on: (a) the functional model form (logit and Gompit), (b) the period length adjustment method (annualized, covariate, and exposure), and (c) the data structure used (traditional or all multiple combinations of the time series). Our findings indicated that the Gompit functional form outperformed the commonly used logit link function. Furthermore, considering the period length as exposure in a generalized linear mixed-effects model offered better goodness-of-fit than the other examined period length adjustments. Using all the possible combinations of the dynamic data did not improve the prediction capabilities of the model variants, but important differences were found in the statistical inferences of the fitted models. Our results highlighted that understanding tree mortality strongly relies on using a suitable modelling strategy that is capable of both capturing and assigning the sources of variation to the corresponding variables, which was best accomplished using a multi-level, binary, and Gompit-exposure modelling framework in this analysis.},
